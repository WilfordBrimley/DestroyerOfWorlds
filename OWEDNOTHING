First of all we don't owe the community anything, we give updates if we feel like spending time doing it, right now it's the same as before "we are still fixing bugs".

Secondly we are NOT making this for the community, if anything the community has been so toxic we even considered saying "fuck it" and give up or continue but never release anything to the public, we are making this for ourselves because we think it's a very fun project to work on and we learn a ton doing this. People leaving is the least of our concern as they will come back when it's released, we aren't trying to build a community.



Please let us be and do things the way we want.
